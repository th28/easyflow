# tkflow

A small app written in python+tkinter for visually modeling simple network flow problems. Uses the gurobi solver but that could be easily changed. Primarily written as a means to learn more about gui development in python and also a little about gurobi's python bindings. In the future I'd like to rewrite this using something modern like gtk or qt.
